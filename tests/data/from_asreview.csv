1,JOUR,Urban flooding digital twin system framework,"['Ge, Chenyu', 'Qin, Shengfeng']",Systems Science & Control Engineering,"Digital twin-based resilience management systems are essential for improving urban flooding resilience, enabling lifecycle-oriented emergency management as a continuous process rather than discrete phases. However, to the best of our knowledge, currently, there lacks a system framework for supporting the development of an urban flooding digital twin (UFDT) platform capable of managing urban flooding events across the entire management lifecycle. This UFDT framework is required to (1) accommodate UFDT model-generation methods/tools for preparing what-if scenarios, (2) support readiness simulations and evaluations, (3) coordinate various collaborative prevention and intervention services from different stakeholders in response to any flooding emergence, and (4) monitor and forecast the flooding risks in the recovery phase. To fill this gap, in this paper, a new UFDT system framework is developed based on a user-centred product design process with the consideration of the above requirements. It has two key components: a UFDT conceptual model, and a generative methodology for its rapid construction/updating/adaptation to varying levels of detail.

The submodels of the individual disciplines are transferred into a coordination model. Part of the transfer is a conversion into an exchange format. The exchange format allows the import into the model checking application. In the model checking application routines are performed to check the model against collisions and building regulation violations. During the transfer into the exchange format, information may get lost, especially with parameters that are not yet part of the exchange format supported by the authoring software. In recent years, ontologies have been investigated as a feasible approach to combine the submodels, since they model data in a flexible manner. Hence in the conversion process to an application-specific ontology, the data structure of the submodels can widely persist, which could lead to smaller information loss in comparison to converting the data into a standardized exchange format. The evaluation of the geometric properties of the building is indispensable for detecting and analyzing collisions. The basis for the connection of the different sub models could be the BOT (Building Topology Ontology), which defines the topological structure of a building and can be used to represent further building information by linking it with other ontologies. The relevant geometric relationships for the collision model checks have to be derived with a geometry kernel. For the research in this paper pythonOCC, a wrapper for the geometry kernel Open CASCADE is used with the Semantic Web's own query language SPARQL, queries can be formulated to analyze the collision relationships in combination with other semantic information. These queries can be used to verify model correctness. By connecting the information from different domains, more sophisticated tests are possible than in an exchange format dependent model checking application. The goal is to integrate the developed functionalities into a project platform.

10,THES,Class association rule mining using multidimensional numbered information spaces,"['MITOV, Iliya']",,"Data mining is of great importance in the overall process of knowledge discovery. In this dissertation we focused our attention in the part of discoveryoriented methods and especially classification algorithms. Class-Association Rules (CAR) algorithms have a special place within the family of classification algorithms. This type of classifiers offers a number of advantages: efficiency of the training regardless of the training set; easy handling with high dimensionality; very fast classification; high accuracy; classification model easily comprehensible for humans. The main classification workflow of CAR algorithms usually involves three phases: generating the rules, pruning, and recognition. The mining of association rules is a typical data mining task that works in an unsupervised manner. A major advantage of association rules is that they are theoretically capable to reveal all interesting relationships in a database. But for practical applications the number of mined rules is usually too large to be exploited entirely. Hence, a pruning phase is applied in order to build accurate and compact classifiers. The pruning can be applied during preprocessing, simultaneously to the association rules mining, or during post-processing. Different rule quality measures and rule ordering schemes can be applied in the process of rule selection. There are also different options which can be considered for the recognition phase – e.g. to use a simple rule or to use a set of rules with different types of ordering schemas. On the other hand, the process of creating classification models inevitably touches upon the use of appropriate access methods which facilitate access to different kinds of structures used in such algorithms. Our effort had been focused on the memory organization called Multidimensional numbered information spaces which allows to operate with contextfree multidimensional data structures. The program realization of such structures is named ArM 32. Multi-Domain Information Model (MDIM) and respectively Arm 32 are based on the process of replacing names by numbers which allows to use mathematical functions and addressing vectors for accessing the information. Our approach is to use such structures and operations in the implementation of one class association rule classifier in order to provide evidence on the vitality of the idea of using context-free multidimensional data structures and direct access as a powerful tool for knowledge discovery. We have proposed two classification algorithms – Pyramidal Growing Networks (PGN) and Multi-layer Pyramidal Growing Networks (MPGN). PGN creates association rules, optimized for maximal accuracy of produced rules. One of the main characteristics of PGN is that it is a parameter-free classifier. The association rule mining is executed from the longest rules to the shorter ones until no intersections between patterns in the classes are possible. In the pruning phase the contradictions and inconsistencies of more general rules are cleared, after that the pattern set is compacted excluding all more concrete rules within the classes. PGN is introduced as a useful tool for questioning the support-first principle used by many associative classifiers when mining for association rules. PGN reverses the common approach and focuses primarily on the confidence of the association rules and only in a later stage on the support of the rules. The main purpose is twofold: to provide a proof of concept for this new approach and to gather evidence on its potential. MPGN is based on multilayer structure. It involves possibility to escape combinatorial explosion using smart disposing of the information in the multilayer structures called ""pyramids"". These structures can be easily implemented using ArM-structures. These algorithms are implemented in the data mining environment PaGaNe, developed by the team from the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics – Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Iliya Mitov and Krassimira Ivanova are the principal developers. PaGaNe incorporates different types of statistical analysis methods, discretization algorithms, association rule miner, as well as classification algorithms, which all are based on the use of multi-dimensional numbered information spaces. The Lenses dataset is used as a test example to illustrate the specifics of the proposed algorithms, the process of creating classification models as well as the process of recognition. We demonstrate that PGN produces the pattern set that is both minimal and complete for covering the learning set, which is an indicator for expectation that PGN will produce tight model and good accuracy results. In the case of MPGN we have demonstrated the process of creating main construction elements. We also have illustrated the functionality which allows to visualize how the pyramids are being created and how the queries are being recognized. We carried out experiments with 25 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository [Frank and Asuncion, 2010]. The experiments had been conducted using the data mining environment PaGaNe, the knowledge analysis system Weka, and LUCS-KDD Repository. A comparison between PGN, MPGN and some other CAR algorithms, as well as decision tree and decision rule classifiers which have similar behavior of creating the task model, had been done. One series of experiments aimed to study what accuracy had been obtained while preprocessing real data with different discretizators realized in PaGaNe. We found that in general PGN-classifier trained on data preprocessed by Chimerge with 95trained on data preprocessed by the other discretization methods. The main reason for this is that using Chi-square statistical measure as criterion for class dependency in adjacent intervals of a feature results in good separation between class labels. A second set of experiments studied the process of growing the learning sets and how this reflects on the classification model and the accuracy of PGN and MPGN; more specifically, we studied the critical point of the amount of the learning set in which classification model is relatively compact and the received accuracy stabilizes. Of course this critical point highly depends on the choice of dataset. A third set of experiments were focused on analyzing different exit points of MPGN. The received results showed that in a lot of cases the build constructs lead to excluding only one class as best competitor. Other cases usually fall into competition between classes, where different strategies for ordering the competitors can be applied. A very few cases fall into the way where MPGNalgorithm did not work and alternative choice is given. A fourth set of experiments aimed to analyze the dependencies of classifiers' behaviors when the noise rush in the dataset attributes; for this set we used the Monks1 dataset. The experiments demonstrated that noising in the dataset worsens considerably the accuracy of PGN which had been designed to perform well in clear datasets. However, experiments with other existing classifiers showed that they also were not been able to resist noising attacks. We made the comparison of overall accuracy between PGN, MPGN (with two recognition strategies – S1 and S2), CMAR, OneR, JRip, J48 and REPTree. The Friedman test showed statistical difference between tested classifiers. The post-hoc Nemenyi test showed that our PGN has best overall performance between examined classifiers and MPGN is competitive with CMAR, J48, JRip and REPTree. The experimental results are very positive and show that PGN is competitive with classification methods that build similar classification behavior. At the same time, it has an essential advantage over the other classifiers being parameter free. Furthermore, the empirical results showed that PGN is slightly more sensitive to noise than techniques such as C4.5 and RIPPER. However, its overall accuracy was still very good compared to these classifiers. In general, the results provide evidence that the confidence-first approach yields interesting opportunities for knowledge discovery.",2011///,2011,,,,,,,en,,,,,files/993/1989 D-2011-2451-50 Iliya MITOV.pdf,,[],,,,Phd thesis,,,,0,2025-09-05 15:17:10,

We propose a detailed conceptual traffic model and, based on it, an analytical macro-state model of the system in stationary state, with: Bernoulli–Poisson–Pascal input flow; repeated calls; limited number of homogeneous terminals; losses due to abandoned and interrupted dialling, blocked and interrupted switching, not available intent terminal, blocked and abandoned ringing and abandoned conversation.

9,CONF,Multi-domain virtual network embedding with coordinated link mapping,"['Li, Shuopeng', 'Saidi, Mohand Yazid', 'Chen, Ken']",,"Network Virtualization, which allows the coexistence of various logical networks on shared physical infrastructure, has become popular in recent years. The optimal mapping of virtual resource to physical resource is a major issue in network virtualization. This problem, called virtual network embedding (VNE), has been well explored in the context of one physical domain, which is in practice operated by a single infrastructure provider (InP). However, the needs of virtual network (VN) is rapidly growing, and quite a number of VNs have to be established across multi-domain. For multi-domain VNE, infrastructure providers can no longer just solve their own single domain VNE problem, but have to cooperate to build the whole VN. Therefore, new challenge arises for the multi-domain VNE, compared to traditional single domain VNE. The existing investigations on this problem mainly focus on decomposing a VN to sub VN for each domain, but little attention has been paid to the joint relation between intra-domain and inter-domain (peering) links. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain link mapping method which combines the intra and peering link mapping so as to optimize the overall resource utilization. Our approach is easy to be deployed since it is based on current Internet architecture. Evaluation shows that our approach brings improvements related to existing methods.",2016///,2016,10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772158,,,1,6,,,,,,,,,[],"['Bandwidth', 'III-V semiconductor materials', 'Indium phosphide', 'Peer-to-peer computing', 'Substrates', 'Topology', 'Virtualization']",,"2016 24th international conference on software, telecommunications and computer networks (SoftCOM)",,,,,0,2025-09-05 15:17:35,

14,THES,Storing data using natural language addressing,"['IVANOVA, Krassimira']",,"Large unstructured or semi-structured datasets require a high level of computational sophistication because operations that are easy at a small scale — such as moving data between machines or in and out of storage, visualizing the data, or displaying results —can all require substantial algorithmic ingenuity. As a data set becomes increasingly massive, it may be infeasible to gather it in one place and analyze it as a whole. Thus, there may be a need for algorithms that operate in a distributed fashion, analyzing subsets of the data and aggregating those results to understand the complete set. One aspect of this is the challenge of data assimilation, in which we wish to use new data to update model parameters without reanalyzing the entire data set. This is essential when new waves of data continue to arrive, or subsets are analyzed in isolation of one another, and one aims to improve the model and inferences in an adaptive fashion — for example, with streaming algorithms [NRC, 2013]. In accordance with the actuality of these problems, firstly in [Mitov, 2011] and after that in [Markov et al, 2013] a new idea has been proposed. It is a method for effective building and storing of pattern sets in multi-layer structures during the process of associative rule mining using the possibilities of multi-dimensional numbered information spaces. The main algorithm was called “MPGN”, an abbreviation from ""Multi-layer Pyramidal Growing Networks of information spaces"". The main goal was to extend the possibilities of network structures by using a special kind of multi-layer memory structures called ""pyramids"", which permits defining and realizing new opportunities. The bottleneck of MPGN became the need to search in billions of values of the association rules’ features to convert instances in numbered arrays (vectors). This is a part of preprocessing step of algorithm (see page 97 of [Mitov, 2011]). The process of numbering took considerable time. After numbering, the MPGN algorithm had shown very good results. This work is aimed to propose a solution of the problem of searching in big index structures by proposing a special kind of hashing, so-called “multi-layer hashing”, i.e. by implementing recursively the same specialized hash function to build and resolve the collisions in hash tables. In other words, the main idea consists in using the specialized hashing functions in depth till it is needed. This approach is called “Natural Language Addressing” (NLA) [Ivanova et al, 2012a; Ivanova et al, 2013a; Ivanova et al, 2013d]. The common sense meaning of the concept “address” is such as a description of the location (of a person or organization), as written or printed on mail as directions for delivery [AHD, 2009]; the conventional form by which the location of a building is described [Collins, 2003]; a sign in front of a house or business carrying the conventional form by which its location is described; [WordNet, 2012]. We will use the concept “address” in the sense accepted in the Computer Science: the code that identifies where a piece of information is stored [WordNet, 2012]; a name or number used in information storage or retrieval that is assigned to a specific memory location; the memory location identified by this name or number [AHD, 2009]. Natural Language Addressing (NLA) is a possibility to access information using natural language words as paths to the information. For this purpose the internal encoding of the letters is used to generate corresponded path. The idea of Natural Language Addressing (NL-Addressing) is very simple. It is based on the computer internal representation of the word as strings of codes in a system of encoding (ASCII, UNICODE, etc.). For example, the ASCII encoding of the word „accession” has the next representation: (97, 99, 99, 101, 115, 115, 105, 111, 110). It may be used as array for multi-layer hashing, which indicates a path to point, where the corresponded information may be stored. The main problem in such approach is that the words have different lengths and, in addition, several words may form one phrase and this way to be assumed as single concept. This means that we need tools for managing multi-layer hashing with variable path lengths in an integrated structure. Due to the complexity of MPGN algorithm and the corresponded program system realized in [Mitov, 2011], their redesign and reprogramming for using NLA have to be done after proving the efficiency of NLA realization. Because of this we will concern several types of semi-structured data: ― small datasets - dictionaries, thesauruses, ontologies; ― middle-size and large RDF triple or quadruple datasets, and will provide corresponded experiments and practical implementation. In accordance with this, the PhD research is aimed to propose information model for NL-addressing and corresponded access method as well as the tools for working in such style, theirs main principles, and storing functions. Results presented in this work were implemented in the Institute of Cybernetics V.M. Glushkov at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev. They had been used for storing dictionaries, thesauruses, ontologies, and RDF-graphs, extracted from multiple documents from own databases as well as from different internet sources.",2014///,2014,,,,,,,en,,,,,files/1005/IVANOVA - 2014 - Storing data using natural language addressing.pdf,,[],,,,Phd thesis,,,,0,2025-09-05 15:18:12,
